    <!--<script src="./index.js"></script>
        The browser stops parsing HTML when it sees this script.
        Downloads script.js → executes it → then continues parsing HTML.
        blocks rendering, so it may slow page load. 
        Getting error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerText')
     <script src="script.js" async></script>
        Script is downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing.
        As soon as the script is ready, it executes immediately, pausing HTML parsing.
        Execution order is not guaranteed if multiple async scripts are used.
        Best for independent scripts (e.g., analytics, ads, trackers).
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
        Script is downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing.
        Execution is deferred until after HTML is fully parsed.
        Scripts with defer run in order, top to bottom.
        Best for scripts that depend on the DOM structure.
